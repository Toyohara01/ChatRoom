Server:
    - Handle multiple messages being inputted 
        a. from a single client. 
        b. from multiple clients. 

        c. Organize packet to outline sending of multiple packets. 

    - Thread problem on server side. 
        a. Move thread logic from server to chatroom server.hpp is the "wrapper" and 
           the handler of communicating with all the threads is the chatroom. 

Client:
    - Handle multiple messages being inputted 
        a. from a single client. 
        b. from multiple clients. 


Viewing problem:
    - Print entire chat formatted when receivng new message. If user input buffer is empty print out new message directly using cout<<.
      If user has inputted characters then save users buffers (implied) then traverse vector<Messages> vector to print all contents held
      in the buffer. Could cretae another module named Views.cpp that handles all the logic needed. *.hpp maybe needed up to design to 
      team to figure out.
